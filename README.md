<h1>Custom built Website for security company</h1>

This is a custom made template used for testing website designs for Alpha Security which is a security company based in Aylesbury. This was a scrapped template that was considered for publication and is not fully complete. Currently it is a static webiste just built in html files but if reconsidered it would be implemented using Angular framework and more changes would be added like extra pages and scroll animaions. <br>

<h3>About</h3>

This template was scrapped due to a difference of objectives between myself and Alpha Securities. I have decided to post the code and screenshots of this webpage as I like the design and feel of the website I created and may have potential to continue development in the future.
