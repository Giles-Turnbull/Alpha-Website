                    <p class="description-header-content">
                        Our operations include the systematic and regular monitoring, supervision and management of all aspects of the services involved. This is specific to each individual contract we undertake. Reports are prepared regularly and include an up to date risk assessment for our staff at the customer's site. The provision of this dedicated supervisory and monitoring service is in addition to our terms of agreement and includes regular daily reporting tht occurs between our staff at customer's sites and their supervisors and incurs no additional expense to the customer. We also work closely with others that supply technical services, such as alarms, access control systems, locksmiths and computer based systems to support the manned guarding. We can put our customers in touch with a colleague if such advice is needed on any of the above.
